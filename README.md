    <h2> Windows Installation</h2>
          <p> For Installing on a Windows machine, I reccomend using Anaconda Navigator to manage the virtual enviroment and dependinces for this project.
          You can download the Anaconda Navigator GUI <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/success"> here. </a> </p>
          <p> Once you downloaded the Anaconda navigator, run it and create a new enviroment, and install the libaries listed above. Afterwords, open up an IDE of your choice and clone the main branch repo and set up virtual envrioment.  </p>
          <p> Finally, you can start the program by running the "main.py" file. </p>
